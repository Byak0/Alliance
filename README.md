Welcome to the official GitHub repository of Alliance, a multiplayer mod for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord.

Alliance aims to enhance the multiplayer experience by introducing new features, gameplay mechanics, game modes, and high-quality content, all designed to create a more engaging and entertaining experience.

Through our new Scenario game mode and customized scripts, we also wish to provide powerful tools to map makers and communities to help them create their own experiences.

Mod is under heavy development and still far from completion.
